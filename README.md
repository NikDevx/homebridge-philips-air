Homebridge Plugin for Philips Air Purifiers

**The issues with [homebridge-philips-air](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-philips-air) have been resolved, please uninstall this plugin and install that one. No changes will be needed to your current config. This is now just a wrapper for that plugin, and installs the latest version at install time, but won't get automatic updates.**

If you have an HTTP unit, you can skip steps 1-3 of the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-philips-air#installation).
